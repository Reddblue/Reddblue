## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Reddblue
I am a fullstack developer & penetration tester. On the side, I like trading & investing. I also enjoy creating content and do graphic design.

## ðŸ‘€ About Me
I am an aspiring developer that started playing around in the programming world ever since I was 12. Now, I do a little bit of everything, from fullstack development to penetration testing (ethical hacking). Other than programming, I play games, learn different languages, focus on self improvement, and study.

## ðŸŒ± Main Goals
Right now I am focusing in data science, especially in algorithmic trading. My goal is to develop an algo that can trade the markets with an accuracy of 60% and can also automatically manage risk by adjusting trade positions & other factors.
Because of that, I have put aside pentesting and my other hobbies for now.
