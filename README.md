## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Reddblue
I am a 16 year old fullstack developer & penetration tester. I also create content and do graphic design.

## ðŸ‘€ About Me
I am an aspiring developer that started playing around in the programming world ever since I was 12. Now, I do a little bit of everything, from fullstack development to penetration testing (ethical hacking). Other than programming, I play games, do content creation, 3D modelling, and study.

## ðŸŒ± Main Goals
Right now I am focusing on mastering front-end development, since I have no prior job experience and it is the more common and safer option for junior developers.
Because of that, I have put aside pentesting and my other hobbies for now. Right now, my main goals are to try and make professional projects and a job-ready portfolio.
