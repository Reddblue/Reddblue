## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Reddblue
I am a self-taught programmer, currently majoring in information systems. On the side, I like trading and investing. I also enjoy creating content, do graphic design, learning foreign languages and studying all fields of knowledge.

## ðŸ‘€ About Me
I am an aspiring developer that started playing around in the programming world ever since I was 12, when I started off creating and modding Minecraft servers. Now, I do a little bit of everything, from fullstack development to penetration testing (ethical hacking). Sometimes I do enjoy video games, watching movies, cooking food, and going out.


Recently I have start up a new company called Alpha Zenith Group, which will mainly focus on the fintech sector and conduct business as an investment/asset fund manager. Still in the process of creating a proven, consistent and appealing track record performance in order to hopefully start pitching to investors or break into private equity/venture capital. I have several trading strategies and models in mind and currently in the phase of performance & consistency testing.


Going deeper into the finance rabbit hole, it made me realize and appreciate the realm of mathematics more. I used to think complex mathematics were useless in your average daily life, but maturing is realizing that mathematics is simply a mere human's interpretation of trying to understand the universe, i.e. it is the language of the universe. Once I found out that the economy, markets and prices were not random and mathematical models & formula can visualize and predict data, I knew I had to find out more.
This got me hooked to study more advanced concepts of maths that relates or gives a clearer understanding on the nature of price, which I previously thought was purely random, but in fact it isn't. Market prices are chaotic, not random, and this introduced me to learning more about Chaos Theory. And so I dug deeper, that is my story.

## ðŸŒ± Main Goals
Currently I have many projects that are on development stage. I am now mainly focused on learning finance & applying my technological skills in addition. Right now I am working to improve my own trading strategy and soon code a reinforced learning AI based on my strategy. I am also experimenting/testing new strategies with other financial instruments such as options, implementing mathematical or statistical models that finds alpha (potential profit) with minimal risk. In short, basically trading volatility after calculating all the greeks.


Putting that aside, I am also aiming to improve my portfolio and value by achieving certifications such as CCNA, Security+, and financial certifications such as CFA and BMC.
